# Event Booking Application

**By Oliver Tomkins**

[TOC]

#### `PROJECT GOAL`

> Complete event booking app with WPF front with test-driven development. Allows user to create, update and manage their events and display this information to users. Development cycle is tracked through project board and documentation is updated regularly.

#### `PROJECT DEFINITION OF DONE`

- The event data is presented in a WPF app that splits them up into venue, events, performers etc.
- Entity framework and CRUD functionality are used to manage the relationship with the DB.
- Tests are used to make sure we are communicating with the database as we expect (adding, removing, updating).  These tests pass and more are implemented with added functionality.
- Bugs are recorded and prioritised accordingly.
- Documentation is updated with each Sprint and effectively shows the uses of the app and the project lifecycle.
- Project and documentation delivered on time: 10/22/20 14:00.

#### `USER STORY DEFINITION OF DONE`

> A User story is complete when the user's specifications have been met. This has been implemented within the business layer of the app and unit testing has been used to test its functionality. Acceptance criteria have been ticked off and any alterations or changes are documented and brought into the next sprint when incomplete.
